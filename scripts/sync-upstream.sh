#   sync-upstream.sh target [TAG]   Print the upstream tag to sync (the latest
#                                   stable one by default), or "up-to-date".
#   sync-upstream.sh merge TAG      Create sync/upstream-TAG from HEAD with:
#     1. "Merge upstream tag TAG": upstream's changes since the last sync, merged
#        automatically, with nothing of the fork's added. Fork-owned paths
#        (scripts/fork-owned.txt) take upstream's version here.
#     2. "chore: apply Qdrant adaptations ...": the fork's version of those paths
#        put back, then the output of scripts/rename-api-groups.sh and of
#        `make tidy`. Skipped when there is nothing to change.
#
# A merge with conflicts is committed as it is, together with a file listing the
# conflicting files (.sync-upstream-conflicts), so that CI fails until someone
# resolves them and deletes that file. Not every conflict leaves markers in the
# files (a file deleted upstream and modified here does not), hence the list. The
# fork-owned paths are still put back in a commit of their own, so that upstream's
# versions of them (its CI, for example) never end up on the branch.
#
# Environment: UPSTREAM_URL (this fork's upstream, the default below), SKIP_TIDY
# (skip `make tidy`), GITHUB_OUTPUT (when set, results are appended to it).
